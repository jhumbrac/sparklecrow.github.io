			<h2>Here's a Headline</h2>

			<p>Here are the first three lines of text. They bring the reader in and show them they want to read more. There may be a lot of text in those three lines or a little.</p>

			<p>Now There is more text becasue we are on the full page of the article. It has lots of words and pretty thoughts and ideas.</p>

			<p>Aren't you glad to be reading this? What could be better than rambling text that is just here to fill the space so we can style the page? Even more rambling text, that's what.
